1. In Python, we can use the # symbol to create single-line comments. For multi-line comments, we can enclose the text within triple quotes (''' or """).   
                                  In Python, there are two main types of comments: single-line comments and multi-line comments.
                                  
2.In Python, variables are used to store and manipulate data. A variable is essentially a name that refers to a value in memory. It provides a way to store data for later use and to perform operations on that data

                               Here's how we declare and assign values to variables:
                                  (i)  Basic Assignment: Use the assignment operator (=) to assign a value to a                                                variable.
                                  (ii)Multiple Assignments:  we can assign multiple values to multiple variables in a                                          single line, separating them with commas.
                                  (iii)Simultaneous Assignment: we can swap the values of variables using simultaneous                                          assignment.
                                  (iv)Increment and Decrement:Python supports shorthand notation for incrementing and                                           decrementing variables.
                                  (v)Updating Variables: we can update variables based on their current values
                                  (vi)Naming Conventions: Choose meaningful variable names that reflect the purpose of                                         the variable. Variable names should be lowercase with underscores for readability                                        (snake_case).
                                  
3.We can use various functions to convert one data type to another in Python. Here are some common conversion functions:

int(): Converts a value to an integer.
float(): Converts a value to a floating-point number.
str(): Converts a value to a string.
list(): Converts an iterable (like a tuple or string) to a list.
tuple(): Converts an iterable to a tuple.      

Example:                 x = "5"
                         int_x = int(x)       # Converts the string "5" to an integer 5

                         y = 3.14
                        str_y = str(y)       # Converts the float 3.14 to the string "3.14"
                        
4.To write and execute a Python script from the command line, follow these steps:

                         Create a new text file with a .py extension (e.g., myscript.py).
                         Open the file in a text editor and write your Python code.
                           Save the file.
                          Open a command prompt or terminal.
                            Navigate to the directory where your script is located using the cd command (change                                    directory).
                        Execute the script using the python command followed by the script's filename:
                            sh
                          
                         python myscript.py
                         
                         
Q5. Slicing a List:
                  To obtain the sub-list [2, 3] from the given list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], we can use slicing:

                    
                        my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
                      sub_list = my_list[1:3]
                        print(sub_list)  # Output: [2, 3]
                        
                        
Q6. Complex Numbers:
In mathematics, a complex number is a number that can be expressed in the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers and i is the imaginary unit (âˆš-1).

In Python, complex numbers are represented using the complex() function or by directly using the j suffix for the imaginary part. For example:

python
Copy code
z1 = complex(3, 4)  # Creates the complex number 3 + 4j
z2 = 2 + 5j         # Also creates the complex number 2 + 5j


Q7. Declaring and Assigning a Variable:
            To declare a variable named age and assign the value 25 to it:

              python
            
               age = 25
               
               
Q8. Variable Data Type:
    The variable price with the value 9.99 belongs to the float data type, which represents floating-point numbers      (decimal numbers).


Q9. Printing a Variable:
                To print the value of the variable name, we can use the print() function:

             python
            
           name = "sindhu shekhar"
              print(name)  # Output: sindhu shekhar
              
              
Q10. Extracting a Substring:
To extract the substring "World" from the given string "Hello, World!", we can use string slicing:

          python
       
           s = "Hello, World!"
          substring = s[7:12]
           print(substring)  # Output: World
           
           
Q11. Declaring a Boolean Variable:
To declare a variable named is_student and assign it a boolean value (e.g., True if i am a student, False otherwise):

       python
        
           is_student = True  # Change to False if not a student
